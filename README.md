# Legos
- A collection of problems on structures and algorithms.
- Each crate under `src/bin` corresponds to exactly one problem.
- There is no dependency b/w any two crates
- Unit testing is used to add manual test cases.

# Usage
- Use `cargo run --bin <crate>` to run (the main function of, not the tests) a crate.
- Use `cargo test` to run tests in all crates.
- A crate corresponding to a codeforces problem is a single file and can be submitted as-is.
